    feature at this point and may change in the future
  * Internal: Replaced AUC function with more efficient version using
    survival package
  * Fixed: Penalty.factor for cv.ncvsurv when some columns may be degenerate

# ncvreg 3.5-0 (2015-10-27)
  * New: Added function AUC() to calculate cross-validated AUC values
    for ncvsurv models.

    matrices when fitting and cross-validating Cox regression models.
  * Internal: Better double/int type checking for penalty.factor
  * Internal: Modifications to NAMESPACE for compatibility with R 3.3.

    predict() methods work properly, but ncvreg will now allow you to pass a
    data frame with factors and handle things appropriately.
  * Fixed: In predict.ncvsurv, when applied to models with saturation issues.
  * Fixed: Small memory leak in ncvsurv.

    with predict, plot, and cv.ncvsurv support functions.  Currently, Cox models
    are the only type of survival model implemented.

    Brown)
  * Fixed: In cv.ncvreg, when attempting to use leave-one-out cross-validation
    (thank you to Cajo ter Braak for pointing this out)

  * New: Made ncvreg_fit more user-friendly: user no longer has to specify
    lambda, works with coef, predict, plot, etc.
  * Changed: Modified order of arguments for predict so that 'type' comes
    before 'lambda' and 'which'
  * Fixed: Bug in convexMin when used with penalty.factor option
  * Internal: Updated algorithm to 'hybrid' strong/active cycling

    estimating and displaying false inclusion rates; these are likely to evolve
    over the next few months

  * Internal: Revised algorithms to incorporate targeted cycling based on strong
    rules
  * Internal: Moved standardization to C

    processing
  * New: Added vertical.line and col options to plot.cv.ncvreg
  * Fixed: Bug in axis annotations with plot.cv.ncvreg when model is saturated
  * Fixed: Deviance calculation; would return NaN if fitted probabilities of 0
    or 1 occurred for binomial outcomes
  * Fixed: NAMESPACE for coef.cv.ncvreg and predict.cv.ncvreg
  * Internal: .Call now used instead of .C

# ncvreg 2.5-0 (2013-03-16)
  * New: Options in plot.cv.ncvreg to plot estimates of r-squared,
    signal-to-noise ratio, scale parameter, and prediction error in addition to
    cross-validation error (deviance)
  * New: Summary method for cv.ncvreg which displays the above information at
    lambda.min, the value of lambda minimizing the cross-validation error
  * Fixed: Bug in cv.ncvreg with user-defined lambda values.

# ncvreg 2.4-0 (2012-10-10)
  * New: penalty.factor option
  * New: coef and predict methods now accept lambda as argument
  * New: logLik method (which in turn allows AIC/BIC)
  * Changed: cv.grpreg now returns full data fit as well as CV errors
  * Fixed: Error in definition/calculation of cross-validation error and
    standard error
  * Fixed: Bug that arose if lambda was scalar (instead of a vector)
  * Fixed: Bug in cv.ncvreg for linear regression -- cross-validation was being
    carried out deterministically (Thank you to Brenton Kenkel for pointing this
    out)
  * Fixed: Intercept for logistic regression was not being calculated for
    lamda=0
  * Internal: standardization more efficient
  * Internal: cdfit_ now returns loss (RSS for gaussian, deviance for binomial)

# ncvreg 2.3-2 (2011-05-16)
  * Documentation: Fixed formatting error in citation.
  
# ncvreg 2.3-1 (2011-05-11)
  * Changed: plot.ncvreg: Made the passing of arguments for plot.ncvreg more
    flexible, so that user can pass options concerning both the plot and the
    lines
  * Changed: plot.ncvreg: Changed some of the default settings with respect to
    color (hcl instead of hsv) and line width

# ncvreg 2.3 (2011-05-06)
  * Documentation: Updated documentation for cv.ncvreg.Rd, which no longer
    agreed with the function usage (this was an oversight in the release of
    version 2.2)

# ncvreg 2.2 (2011-04-25)
  * New: plot.cv.ncvreg for plotting cv.ncvreg objects
  * Changed: Divorced cross-validation from fitting in cv.ncvreg.  From a user
    perspective, this increases flexibility, although obtaining the model with
    CV-chosen regularization parameter now requires two calls (to ncvreg and
    cv.ncvreg).  The functions, however, are logically separate and involve
    entirely separate methods.
