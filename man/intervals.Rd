\title{Projection base test statistics and intervals}
\usage{
intervals(
  fit,
  lambda,
  sigma,
  level = 0.95,
  posterior = TRUE,
  relaxed = FALSE,
  adjust_projection = FALSE,
  X = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{fit}{An optional fit of class \code{ncvreg} or \code{cv.ncvreg}. If supplied,
\code{X} should only be supplied if \code{fit} does not contain it.}

\item{lambda}{The penalty at which the tests and intervals are to
be constructed. If left unspecified, will be selected using
cross validation.}

\item{sigma}{Standard deviation estimate used to compute test statistic and
intervals. If left unspecified (default) it will be
estimated using the recommendation from Reid et al. (2016)}

\item{level}{the confidence level required.}

\item{posterior}{whether the intervals returned should be posterior intervals
(default) or debiased intervals (if \code{FALSE}). Posterior
intervals are constructed from distributions where the estimate
is the posterior mode. Debiased intervals are constructed
around the test statistic.}

\item{relaxed}{whether the relaxed lasso based statistic / intervals should
be used. Default is \code{FALSE} in which case PIPE based intervals
are constructed (recommended). This affects the estimate.}

\item{adjust_projection}{whether a Local Quadratic Approximation should be
used in the projection for determining variance of the PIPE
based test statistic. Default is \code{FALSE} as more research has
been done without this adjustment, however without this
adjustment, statistics and intervals may be over conservative in
the presence of correlation. This affects the SE.}

\item{X}{The original design matrix supplied to \code{fit}. Required if \code{fit}
does not contain \code{X}.}
}
\value{
An \code{data.frame} containing the following columns:
\describe{
\item{variable}{\code{colnames(X)}}
\item{coef}{The original estimates at the specified parameters (\code{lambda}, \code{gamma}, \code{alpha})}
\item{estimate}{The PIPE / Relaxed Lasso estimates}
\item{SE}{The PIPE / LQA standard errors. The Relaxed Lasso SEs are the same as PIPE's.}
\item{t}{The PIPE / Relaxed Lasso / LQA test statistics}
\item{lower}{Interval lower bounds}
\item{upper}{Intervals upper bounds}
\item{p.value}{The unadjusted p-value}
\item{p.adjust}{The Benhamini and Hochberg corrected p-value}
\item{penalty}{The penalty used.}
\item{lambda}{The lambda value the test statistics and intervals were constructed at.}
\item{gamma}{The gamma value the test statistics and intervals were constructed at (for MCP/SCAD).}
\item{alpha}{The alpha value the test statistics and intervals were constructed at.}
\item{level}{The confidence level set for interval construction.}
\item{sigma}{The standard deviation used for constructing the test statistis and intervals.}
}
}
\description{
Constructs projection based test statistics that can be used to control FDR
along with intervals for a penalized regression model.
}
\details{
The function constructs test statistics and intervals based off an
approximate projection onto the column space of the active features. The test
statistic can be used to control FDR and the intervals generally
have good coverage. However, both tend to be conservative with the
introduction of correlation.

\examples{
# Linear regression (SCAD-Net penalty, PIPE intervals, pass ncvreg object)
fit <- ncvreg(Prostate$X, Prostate$y, penalty = "SCAD", alpha = 0.9)
intervals(fit) |> head()

# Logistic regression (lasso penalty, LQA intervals, pass cv.ncvreg object) 
data(Heart)
cv_fit <- cv.ncvreg(Heart$X, Heart$y, family="binomial", penalty = "lasso")
intervals(cv_fit, adjust_projection = TRUE) |> head()
